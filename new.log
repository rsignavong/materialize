                                WARNING!
!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Starting Materialize in experimental mode means:

- This node's catalog of views and sources are unstable.

If you use any version of Materialize besides this one, you might
not be able to start the Materialize node. To fix this, you'll have
to remove all of Materialize's data (e.g. rm -rf mzdata) and start
the node anew.

- You must always start this node in experimental mode; it can no
longer be started in non-experimental/regular mode.

For more details, see https://materialize.com/docs/cli#experimental-mode
